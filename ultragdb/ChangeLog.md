Running 'mvn verify -P baseline-compare-and-replace' to make sure all versions
have been appropriately incremented. The check output is very verbose, so it is
redirected to baseline-compare-and-replace.log which is archived as part of the build artifacts.
The following bundles are missing a service segment version bump:
  - org.eclipse.cdt.core
Please bump service segment by 100 if on master branch
The log of this build is part of the artifacts
See: https://wiki.eclipse.org/Version_Numbering#When_to_change_the_service_segment

Error: Process completed with exit code 1.

# Replace toOSString to toString

To use '/' as file separator on Windows. It should have no side effect on Linux and macOS.

```
toOSString   org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPath.toOSString()
toString
```


Also pay attention to the following fields:
```
File.separator       java.io.File.separatorChar
IPath.SEPARATOR      org.eclipse.core.runtime.IPath.SEPARATOR
IncludeSearchPathElement.NON_SLASH_SEPARATOR
RemotePath.RUNNING_ON_WINDOWS
PATH_SEPARATOR
FILE_SEPARATOR
```
